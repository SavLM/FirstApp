Re-learning how to develop android apps

This repository contains my progress while working my way through Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide by Bill Phillips and Brian Hardy.
I did this to re-familiarize myself Android development.
This was put on hault when I went back to school, but I hope to resume it soon now that I have graduated.
